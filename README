Description

This program is PC-side software for programming Dallas
Semiconductor's Ultra-High-Speed Flash Microcontrollers
DS89C420/430/440/450. It is basically a terminal program, giving
access to boot-rom functions in programming mode. It also provides
functions for loading/verifying flash memory, encryption vector and
external memory, as well as grabbing output to a file.
More information about microcontrollers can be found at this site:
http://www.maxim-ic.com/
See application notes for information on how to build an interface
board for In-System Programming.
This program is portable, open-source supplement to software available
at Maxim's website, which runs only on Microsoft Windows. It is
written in C and depends on GNU libc.
Before using this program, read at least section 15 ("Program
Loading") of "DS89C420 Ultra-High-Speed Flash Microcontroller User's
Guide", available at www.maxim-ic.com .

Tarball is shipped with precompiled version of dsmtk. If you have
appropiate development tools, you are encouraged to delete this file
("dsmtk") and build it again issuing "make" command.

dsload is a simple shell script that takes one argument - a name of
Intel hex file to be loaded into flash memory. When run, first it
clears flash by issuing 'K' command, and then loads new content from
given file.

Issue "dsmtk --help" to get list of available command-line options.

--------------------------------------------------
Examples

Commands accepted by high-speed microcontroller are descripted in the
document mentioned above. You can list additional (built-in) functions
of dsmtk issuing /help command.

Example 1. Loading hex file into flash (program) memory

dsload file.hex

or (in dsmtk shell):

K
/load file.hex

All the following examples assume that dsmtk is running and connection
is estabilished.

Example 2. Display values of registers

R

output example:

R
LB:00 OCR:FF ACON:1F CKCON:01 P0:00 P1:FF P2:FF P3:FF FCNTL:B1

Example 3. Dump program memory from 0 to 40 (hex)

D 0 40

output example:

D 0 40

:200000000200FAFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0200F9FFFFFFFFFF020027FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFD7
:20002000FFFFFF02002632C2A7B280D281C0E0C0F0E8C0E0EAC0E0C0D078A07400F67A008D
:01004000C2FD
:00000001FF

Example 4. Dump external (MOVX) memory from 0 to 40, grabbing output
to 'dump.hex' (input mixed with output, input is indented by 2 spaces)

  /grab dump.hex
Grabbing output to dump.hex
